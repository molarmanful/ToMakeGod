# The Great Undrying

A dry day just like any other.

Sitting among the the dry wheat, under a dry sun, feeling the dry wind blow dry dust onto my dry skin.

The archives told of a magical concoction called moisturizer which - when applied to dry skin - was able to un-dry it.

They put them in everything they could imagine: machine workers, machine chefs, machine dogs and cats and birds. And as Decadence bit the hands of the humans that fed it and their world came crashing down, the people of BACK THEN turned to
