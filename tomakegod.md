# TO MAKE GOD

"And God has decreed today's Number to be 64."

The congregation gathered among the church pews murmured in satisfaction. 64 was a perfect square and a power of eight, four, and two. An upstanding citizen of a two-digit number, a power above powers, superseded only in raw size by 81 - and even then, 81 simply wasn't as elegant or refined as 64. 64 was a number meant for God.

The man who had just delivered God's daily Number was Pastor 18. His full name was 18 37; despite being born with such mundane numbers, Pastor 18 managed to overcome the predetermined mediocrity of his name to become God's personal messenger.
